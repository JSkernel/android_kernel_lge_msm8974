	Updating LG G2 configs

This directory has scripts to update the LG G2 kernel configs, which is 
a way to maintain updates across all variants until a method to have a 
commonized config is merged across distribution build systems. In order
to use this method, first update the cyanogenmod_d802_defconfig. Then run
the following commands from the kernel root directory:
	cd arch/arm/configs/g2-update
    ./all.sh

This will run the scripts that will remove the other variants configs and
replace them with the d802 config and then make the necessary changes for
each variant.
